# Sentiment-Analysis-and-Time-Series-forecasting-of-Amazon-Product-Reviews
The Amazon product review sentiment analysis project is aimed at developing a machine learning model that can automatically analyze the sentiment of product reviews on Amazon and classify them as positive, negative, or neutral. The project involves the collection of a large dataset of Amazon product reviews, pre-processing and cleaning of the data, and using techniques such as bag-of-words, n-grams, and word embeddings. The model is trained on a subset of the data and evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, and F1 score. The project also involves the identification of important features from the reviews to provide additional insights into customer satisfaction and preferences. The ultimate goal of the project is to provide valuable insights to Amazon sellers and customers, which can help them make informed decisions about products and services. The project also involves the use of time-series analysis to account for trends and seasonality in the data. The ultimate goal of the project is to provide Amazon sellers with a forecast of future sentiments, which will help them meet customer demands and make data-driven decisions about pricing, marketing, and product development.
